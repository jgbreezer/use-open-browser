Found this command below which might be useful (or modification of) for installing (we should back up old value first, as config file default). The command selects use-open-browser as default mime handler in ubuntu recent versions (replaces nautilus with nemo file browser):

DON'T RUN THIS unless you know what you're doing, this affects your file browser and not use-open-browser!
xdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory application/x-gnome-saved-search
